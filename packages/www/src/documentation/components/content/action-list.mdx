An Action List is a table that allows users to perform a row-level actions. Common use cases might include:

- A user list with each row containing a user's details and a "Delete User" action.
- A group permissions list with each row containing a group's set of permissions and an "Edit Permissions" action.
- A query list with each row containing metadata on a recently run query and a "Rerun Query" action.

The `ActionList` component is the main wrapper to other Action List related components. It must receive an array of type `ActionListColumns` in its `columns` prop.

```jsx
;() => {
  const columns = [
    {
      canSort: true,
      id: 'id',
      primaryKey: true,
      title: 'ID',
      type: 'number',
      widthPercent: 20,
    },
    {
      canSort: true,
      id: 'name',
      title: 'Name',
      type: 'string',
      widthPercent: 80,
    },
  ]

  return <div>Hello World</div>
}
```
